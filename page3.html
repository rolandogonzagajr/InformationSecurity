<h2>Limit Overrun Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Limit overrun conditions, particularly in the context of race conditions, present a significant threat to the integrity and security of an application's business logic.
        This report delves into a specific scenario within an online store environment where the misuse of promotional codes exposes vulnerabilities.
        The application's susceptibility arises during the transition through a temporary sub-state, allowing users to exploit a race window and exceed imposed limits, potentially leading to misuse of discounts, gift cards, product ratings, and financial transactions.
    </p>

    <div class="sample-section">
        <h2>Samples:</h2>

        <h3>Promotional Code Exploitation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Users exploit the race condition to use a promotional code multiple times.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Unintended discounts, potential revenue loss for the online store.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploiting Race Conditions in Gift Card Redemption:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Impact: Loss of value for the business, potential exploitation by users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Users Manipulate the System to Submit Multiple Ratings for a Product:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Impact: Distorted overall product rating.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Users Attempt to Withdraw or Transfer Amounts Exceeding Their Account Balance:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Impact: Financial discrepancies and potential losses.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Multi-Endpoint Race Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Multi-endpoint race conditions pose a significant threat, particularly when sending simultaneous requests to different endpoints.
        This report explores a common logic flaw in online stores where users can exploit the race condition by manipulating the order processing flow.
        Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when adding items to a cart, making a payment, and then adding more items before reaching the order confirmation page.
    </p>

    <div class="sample-section">
        <h2>Sample:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users can add more items during the critical window between payment validation and order confirmation.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Additional items may be included in the order before confirmation, leading to incorrect order states.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

 <h2>Single-Endpoint Race Conditions</h2>
    <p>
        Single-endpoint race conditions can arise when parallel requests with different values are sent to a single endpoint.
        This report explores a scenario involving a password reset mechanism that stores user ID and reset token in the user's session.
    </p>

    <div class="sample-section">
        <h2>Sample:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Collision in Password Reset: Sending two parallel password reset requests with different usernames from the same session.</li>
            <li><strong>Impact:</strong> Collision in session data, potentially resetting the password for the wrong user.</li>
        </ul>
